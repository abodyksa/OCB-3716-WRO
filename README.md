# OCB-3716-WRO
We are coding a robot to win the WRO
The robot is programmed to stay in the center of the lane by sensing the distances to its right and left and trying to make them equal by turning away from walls.
It also has a function that makes the robot reverse whenever it hits the wall, so it doesn't get stuck.
